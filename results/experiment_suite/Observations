1. Balancing in BFS:

-> BFS1 has more I/O time than BFS2 because we need work stealling
-> BFS3 has clear much more work to do durring scatter than BFS4 due to linear partition search and not use of caching.
-> BFS4 should be computational balanced but not I/O balanced while BFS5 is I/O balanced but not computational balanced , thus the slightly consistent scatter barrier time.

Overall, for the first 5 experiments we cleary see our load balance improved, but there is still work to do.

2. Locality

-> when edges are locall updates need to be written remotely so, without batch I/O this creates big scatter time. Notice that in BFS6 the scatter unbalance is smaller. This might be due to different unbalanced patterns when writting updates.

3. Others
-> when we partition for same edge set, last partition is smaller => imbalance

-> when optimizing for state load and store and partition for same edge set we can see how well balance is everything
